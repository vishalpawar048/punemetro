      <h2 id="heading">2. Fergusson College</h2>
      <p>
        With the end of the East India Company's regime in India and the failure
        of the first armed uprising in 1857, for India's freedom, a new era
        dawned in our country. It was clear that the emancipation of our land
        and the transformation of the life of our people had to be brought about
        by peaceful and constitutional means. Indian renaissance had began and
        it heralded the role which education needed to play to achieve national
        aspirations. Wood's Education Despatch (1854), the Education Commission
        of 1882 and the Hunter Commission (1891), were all indicative of the
        concerted efforts, of both the Government and the Indian people, in the
        enterprise of education. The Founders of the Fergusson College had first
        started the New English School, Pune in 1880 and later established the
        Deccan Education Society (DES) in 1884.The college held these classes,
        for almost ten years, in the old Gadre Wada and other locations in
        Poona. A plot of about 37 acres (a portion of the present extensive
        campus) was acquired on a 99 years' lease in 1891 by the DES. The
        foundation stone of the Main building of the Fergusson College, was laid
        in 1892 and the building was completed in 1895. The college started
        functioning on this campus in 1895. From then onwards, the college has
        grown from strength to strength and acquired a reputation as a
        nation-building institution.
        <p></p>While the founders have become legends, in the history of
        education and the freedom struggle in India, it is a matter of great
        significance, that the college received active and moral support from
        academicians and statesmen, such as Principal William Wordsworth,
        Principal F. G. Selby, Lord Rippon, Sir William Wedderburn and Sir James
        Fergusson.Fergusson College was intended to be, "the seminary of the
        Indian educational missionaries".
